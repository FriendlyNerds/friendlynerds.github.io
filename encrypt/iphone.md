# Encrypting your iPhone

**Do you have a passcode on your iPhone? Chances are your device is already encrypted!**

Confirm your phone is encrypted by going to *Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode* and look for "Data protection is enabled." at the bottom of the page.

**Don't have a passcode? You should add one immediately**

Go to *Settings -> Touch ID & Passcode* and follow the prompts.
