# Encrypting your Windows laptop

**Don't have Windows 10?**

Unfortunately there is no simple way to encrypt your device.

**Have Windows 10?**

Check if your device supports native device encryption:

Select the *Start* button, then select *Settings* > *Update & Security* > *Device encryption.*

If Device encryption doesn't appear, it isn't available. 

If device encryption is turned off, select *Turn on*. 

**If your device does not support native device encryption:**

Do you have Windows 10 Pro? If so, you can use BitLocker instead:

Select the *Start* button, and then under *Windows System*, select *Control Panel*. In *Control Panel*, select S*ystem and Security*, and then under *BitLocker Drive Encryption*, select *Manage BitLocker*.
